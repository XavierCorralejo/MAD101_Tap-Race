In this chapter, we learn about the widget tree. It is like a map that shows how widgets are arranged in an app. A widget is anything in the app, like text, buttons, or images. The tree starts with one main widget at the top, called the root widget, and it has smaller widgets under it, called child widgets. These child widgets can also have their own children. This tree structure helps the app know how to display and organize everything on the screen.
